## Description
Hands-on lab where code animates objects; build kinetic pieces with Arduino.

## Outcomes
- Wire and code digital/analog pins
- Fabricate sturdy enclosures
- Iterate with quick tests
- Share work-in-progress for critique
- Log assumptions and power needs

## Weekly arc
Week 1 basics, Week 2 motion, Week 3 sensors, Week 4 refinement, Week 5 show.

## Major assignments
- [Kinetic object](assignments/kinetic-object.md)
- [Process log](../shared/templates/process-log.md)

## Assessment
[RUBRIC](assessment/rubric.md)

## Access/UDL
Bench heights varied; captioned demos; flexible deadlines.

## Policies
[AI use](../shared/policies/ai-use.md), [Safety: soldering](../shared/policies/safety-soldering.md)

## Documentation expectations
Maintain a [process log](../shared/templates/process-log.md) and [assumption ledger](../shared/templates/assumption-ledger.md)
