# MCAD Arduino Sculpture

Fragments from my Arduino Sculpture class for MCAD. This folder just holds a local copy of the syllabus (`sc3082_arduino.odt`). The full kit—assignments, code, build notes—lives in a separate repo: <https://github.com/bseverns/ArduinoSculpture_MCAD>.

Clone that, wire up some LEDs, and make your sculptures misbehave.
