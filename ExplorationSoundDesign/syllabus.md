# Intro to Sound Design & Engineering (Mobile/Chromebook)

**Format:** 22 sessions · 60 minutes each · meets 4×/week

**Primary tools:** Cell phones (mixed iOS/Android), Chromebooks  
**Hands‑on gear:** Korg/littleBits Synth Kit (frequent access)

## Course Promise
We’ll turn everyday sound into story. Using only a phone, a Chromebook, and a handful of tiny synth blocks, you’ll learn to capture, sculpt, and arrange sound for music, podcasts, games, and film moments. By the end, you’ll publish a polished mini‑project that *sounds* like you.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. **Record clean audio** on a phone in varied environments and manage files on a Chromebook.
2. **Edit and arrange** multi‑track projects (trims, fades, crossfades, clip gain, comping, markers).
3. **Design sounds** via sampling (phones) and subtractive synthesis (littleBits): oscillators, filters, envelopes, LFOs.
4. **Apply effects** with purpose: EQ, compression, saturation/distortion, reverb, delay, modulation.
5. **Shape space** with stereo image, panning, level balance, automation, and headroom management.
6. **Deliver mixes** that meet basic loudness and dynamic‑range targets for web sharing.
7. **Collaborate and critique** using common vocabulary and constructive feedback rituals.

## Core Platforms & Apps (device‑agnostic)
- **Primary DAW:** **BandLab** (web + iOS/Android) — multitrack editing, sampler, effects, collaboration.
- **Alt/Web DAWs:** **Audiotool**, **Amped Studio**, **Soundtrap** (if available).
- **Recording/Cleanup:** **Dolby On** (iOS/Android) for quick noise‑managed phone recording.
- **Sampling (optional):** **Koala Sampler** (iOS/Android, paid) for beat‑centric workflows.
- **Meters/Analysis:** **Spectroid** (Android) / **SpectrumView** (iOS); **Decibel X** for SPL awareness.
- **Video assembly:** **CapCut** (iOS/Android/Chromebook) or **WeVideo** (web) for picture+sound projects.
- **Cloud storage:** Google Drive (class folder with naming convention), BandLab projects.

> **Note:** Where an app isn’t available, students use the web‑based alternatives. All critical lessons have a “web‑only path.”

## Gear & Classroom Setup
- **littleBits/Korg Synth Kit stations:** oscillator, filter, envelope, delay; provide headphones with splitters.
- **Field kits:** phone, cheap foam windscreen or deadcat, binder clip + rubber band for impromptu stand, tape.
- **Monitoring:** closed‑back headphones (sanitized between uses). SPL awareness signs posted.
- **Rotation model:** 3–4 stations (Record/Foley, Synthesis, Edit/Mix, Analysis) for labs.

## Assessment & Grading
- **Process (30%)**: session exit tickets, check‑ins, file management, iterative saves.
- **Technique (30%)**: capture quality, noise control, gain staging, edits, consistent levels.
- **Design & Story (30%)**: originality, appropriateness of effects, spatial clarity, pacing.
- **Reflection (10%)**: short write‑ups on choices, what changed after critique.

**Rubric anchors (0–4):** 0 = missing, 2 = basic, 3 = proficient, 4 = intentional & polished.

## Safety & Care
- Protect hearing: target **70–80 dB** in class; peaks brief; breaks every 20–30 min.
- Mic etiquette: avoid plosives, wind, and sudden loudness.
- Cable/device safety: tape trip‑hazards, keep liquids away, sanitize shared gear.

## File‑Naming & Workflow
**Convention:** `Last_First_Project_Descriptor_V##` → e.g., `Lee_Ari_FieldRecordings_V02`  
1. Record on phone → export WAV/320 kbps MP3 to Drive.  
2. Import to BandLab (web) → edit/mix → export **stems** and a rough mix.  
3. For video projects, assemble in CapCut/WeVideo → export H.264 MP4.

## Projects & Checkpoints
- **Mini‑Project 1 (Wk2):** Found‑Sound Beat (30–45 sec).  
- **Mini‑Project 2 (Wk4):** Foley/ADR micro‑scene (10–20 sec).  
- **Final Project (Wk5–6):** 20–30 sec picture scene or audio vignette with original recording/synthesis, effects, and a basic master.

**Deliverables:** session exports, stems, screenshots of EQ/comp settings, brief reflections.

## Differentiation & Extensions
- **Advanced:** add bus compression, side‑chain ducking, multi‑band EQ match, binaural trickery.
- **Support:** provide pre‑edited clips, template sessions, guided checklists; partner students.
- **Creative pathways:** music track, podcast bumper, trailer SFX, sound logo, ambient piece.

## Station Cards (teacher‑printable)
- **Record/Foley:** mic distance chart; “3 takes minimum”; room‑tone first.  
- **Synthesis:** choose waveform → filter sweep → envelope shape → record.  
- **Edit/Mix:** trim → fade → label → group → bus → FX.  
- **Analysis:** reference track A/B, EQ curve sketch, LUFS note.

## Quick Checklists (student‑printable)
- **Capture:** mic stable, wind tamed, levels peaking ~−12 dBFS, 5 sec room tone.  
- **Edit:** zero‑crossing trims, crossfades on cuts, name regions.  
- **Mix:** HPF non‑bass, no red meters, reference level matched.  
- **Export:** correct naming, 44.1/48 kHz WAV + MP3, stems labeled.

## Contingencies (Low/No Internet)
- Record to phone → local edit in BandLab mobile → export via cable next day.  
- Use **Chrome Music Lab** for quick theory/ear‑training when DAW access is limited.  
- Offline listening/critique: teacher‑provided audio on shared USB drives.

## Home‑to‑School Bridge
- Encourage a quiet corner at home; blanket‑fort booth.  
- Headphone policy & volume hygiene; timer breaks.

**Teaching note:** Keep the pulse hands‑on. Every technique ties to a sound the student chooses, so skill grows alongside voice. Keep levels kind, curiosity high, and celebrate micro‑wins daily.
