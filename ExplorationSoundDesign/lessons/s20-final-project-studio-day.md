5. Complete the **Exit Ticket** and upload to the Drive folder.

## Teacher Playbook
- Circulate with **one-sentence nudges** (“What problem are you solving with this EQ move?”).
- Enforce **headphones first, then play**; watch for red meters.
- Offer **A/B moments**: solo before/after; ask peers to describe differences.
- Capture 1–2 **exemplars** for tomorrow’s hook.

## Assessment Checks
- Process: correct naming, versioning, assets organized.
- Technique: gain staging, fades/edits clean, no clipping.
- Design: choices match the stated intent.

## Deliverable
- See Exit Ticket notes in the timeline; export or screenshot as specified.

## Accessibility & Supports
- Provide pre‑edited clips or simplified templates as needed.
