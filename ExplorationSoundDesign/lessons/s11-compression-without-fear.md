# S11 — Compression without Fear

**Objective:** Control dynamics; introduce parallel compression.

**Key Vocabulary:** Threshold/Ratio/Attack/Release, Parallel bus  

**Materials:** BandLab; compressor plugin

---

## Setup (Teacher)
- Test playback levels (target 70–80 dB).  
- Confirm BandLab/Apps sign‑in on 2–3 devices.  
- Prepare template/session files and example assets.  
- Post the day’s **file‑naming** and **export** targets on the board.

## Timeline (60 min)
- 5 Hook: smashed vs controlled
- 10 Mini: when/why compress
- 15 Guided: tame voice/synth
- 25 Studio: try New York bus
- 5 Exit: note settings & intent

---

## Student Steps
1. Read the **Objective** and today’s **Deliverable** on the board.
2. Follow the **Mini‑lesson** notes; jot 3 takeaways.
3. Complete the **Guided Practice** exactly (ask if stuck).
4. During **Studio**, save versions often (`V01`, `V02`…), and annotate one decision you made.
5. Complete the **Exit Ticket** and upload to the Drive folder.

## Teacher Playbook
- Circulate with **one-sentence nudges** (“What problem are you solving with this EQ move?”).
- Enforce **headphones first, then play**; watch for red meters.
- Offer **A/B moments**: solo before/after; ask peers to describe differences.
- Capture 1–2 **exemplars** for tomorrow’s hook.

## Assessment Checks
- Process: correct naming, versioning, assets organized.
- Technique: gain staging, fades/edits clean, no clipping.
- Design: choices match the stated intent.

## Deliverable
- See Exit Ticket notes in the timeline; export or screenshot as specified.

## Accessibility & Supports
- Provide pre‑edited clips or simplified templates as needed.
- Pair students strategically; give printed step lists.
- Allow mobile‑only or web‑only paths.

## Homework / Extension (optional)
- 5–10 min listening or capture prompt that feeds next session.

## Prep for Next Session (Teacher)
- Review exports quickly; pick 2 audio moments for tomorrow’s hook.
- Note recurring issues to address in the mini‑lesson.
