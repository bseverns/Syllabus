# Station Card â€” ðŸ”Š Synthesis (Korg/littleBits)

**Goal:** Create drum hits, textures, and tones using subtractive synthesis.

**Modules (typical):** power, oscillator, keyboard, filter, envelope, delay, mixer, splitter, microphone (optional).

## Patch Recipes
- **Kick:** Square â†’ Filter (LP, low cutoff) + short **AD**; add quick pitch drop while recording.
- **Snare:** Noise + short **AD**; Filter (BP/LP); layer a click (very short square).
- **Hiâ€‘hat:** Noise â†’ HP filter; **very short** decay.
- **Pad:** Saw â†’ Filter (LP, moderate resonance) â†’ slow attack, medium release.
- **FX:** Slowly modulate cutoff; twist delay time (warn students about pitch glides).

## Record
1. Set headphone level low â†’ test.
2. Record 3â€“5 s per sound into phone/BandLab.
3. Announce the sound name between takes.

## Design Checklist
- Name the **waveform** and **filter**.
- Does the **envelope** fit the role (percussive vs pad)?
- Nonâ€‘clipping, consistent levels.
