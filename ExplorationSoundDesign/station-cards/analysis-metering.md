# Station Card — 📈 Analysis / Metering

**Goal:** Train ears and eyes; validate decisions.

**Apps:** Spectroid (Android) / SpectrumView (iOS); any SPL meter (e.g., Decibel X).

## Exercises (choose one)
- **Timbre map:** record one sound → screenshot spectrogram → label fundamental + overtones.
- **EQ hunt:** identify the “ugly” region to cut later.
- **Reference A/B:** import a short commercial clip; compare tonal balance at matched volume.
- **SPL awareness:** measure monitoring level; keep 70–80 dB; note peaks.

**Exit Prompt:** What did the graph reveal that your ears almost missed?
