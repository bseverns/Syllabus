# Station Card — 🎙️ Record / Foley

**Goal:** Capture clean, intentional sounds (voice, footsteps, cloth, impacts, ambiences).

**Gear:** phones, foam windscreens/deadcats, binder clip + rubber band (stand), tape, index cards (slates), headphones.

## Steps
1. **Plan (1 min):** What sound? What emotion? Sketch in 10 words.
2. **Slate (5 sec):** “Project, take #, location.”
3. **Room tone (5–10 sec)** before every new location.
4. **Placement:** 15–30 cm for voice; 45–90 cm for loud sources. Aim slightly **off‑axis** to reduce plosives.
5. **Gain:** Target peaks **≈ −12 dBFS**; never clip.
6. **Takes:** Record **3 variations** (close/mid/far or soft/normal/hard).
7. **Notes:** File name + best take on the index card.

## Techniques
- Proximity = warmer; distance = more ambience. Move until it sounds “true.”
- Cloth: bunch and rotate fabric; layer with paper for “crisp.”
- Footsteps: vary shoes/surfaces; cornstarch-in-bag for “snow.”
- Impacts: layer bright click + body thump; separate the “whoosh.”

## Quick QC
- Headphones on; listen back.
- Wind? Handling noise? Redo immediately.

## Export
- Save to Photos/Files → upload **WAV/320 kbps MP3** to Drive → correct naming: `Last_First_Sound_V##`.
