## Quick Start
1. Read **[syllabus.md](./syllabus.md)** for the full arc, projects, rubrics, and checklists.  
2. Set up tech using **[bandlab-setup.md](./bandlab-setup.md)**.
3. Print/laminate station cards from **[station-cards](./station-cards/)**.
4. Teach from **[lessons](./lessons/)**: each day has student steps + teacher playbook.
