# BandLab Setup & Workflow Tips (Classroom)

This guide assumes mixed devices (Chromebooks + iOS/Android). Use **BandLab (web)** on Chromebooks and **BandLab mobile** on phones. If your school supports it, **BandLab for Education** is a great alternative with classroom controls; otherwise a normal BandLab **Group** works.

---

## 1) Accounts & Access
- **Students:** create a BandLab account (email or SSO).  
- **Teacher:** create a **Group** named `Intro Sound Design – Period X` (or use BandLab for Education to create a **Class**).  
- Share the **invite link/code** on day 1; keep it in your LMS/Drive.

**Privacy:** Remind students to set **Projects ➜ Private** (or class‑only) until showcase week.

---

## 2) Classroom Structure in BandLab
- **Pinned Post:** “File naming, export settings, and weekly dropbox link.”  
- **Folders/Collections:** Week 1, Week 2… or by **Projects** (Found‑Sound, Foley, Final).  
- **Templates:** Create a **BandLab project template** with named tracks, color coding, reverb/delay buses, and markers (Intro/Beat/Break/Out). Students **fork** this template for new work.

**Track Naming Template**
- VOX / FOLEY / DRUMS / BASS / MUSIC / FX / AMB / BUS‑MIX

---

## 3) Device Prep (Day 1)
- **Chromebook (web):**  
  1. Log into BandLab in Chrome.  
  2. Allow **Microphone** when prompted.  
  3. Plug in **wired headphones**.  
  4. Close other tabs to reduce CPU load.

- **Phone (mobile):**  
  1. Install **BandLab** (optional: **Dolby On** for cleaner field recording).  
  2. Allow **Mic** and **Files** permissions.  
  3. Use airplane mode (optional) to avoid notifications during takes.

**Optional Workflow:** Record in **Dolby On** → export WAV/MP3 → import into BandLab for editing.

---

## 4) Project Start Checklist (for Students)
1. Create from **Template** (or New Project ➜ Voice/Mic).  
2. Set **Tempo** & **Count‑In**, turn **Metronome** on.  
3. Import field recordings (**Drag & drop** on web; **Import** on mobile).  
4. **Name tracks** and color‑code.  
5. Add **REVERB** and **DELAY** as **effects on buses** (or send tracks to FX buses if using a template).

**Gain Staging**
- Aim for track peaks around **−12 dBFS**, project peak around **−6 dBFS**.  
- Avoid red meters; use **clip gain** before compression.

---

## 5) Editing & Mixing Habits
- Trim to **zero‑crossings**; add **fades** on every cut.  
- **HPF** anything that isn’t kick/bass; subtract before add.  
- Use **parallel compression** for VOX punch without pumping.  
- Use **short reverb** for clarity; longer tails on FX/AMB only.  
- **Markers** for structure; **Groups** for multi‑clip moves.  
- Save often; add a **version note** (“v03: cleaned VOX, softer reverb”).

---

## 6) Exporting (Mix & Stems)
- **Mixdown:** `File ➜ Download ➜ Mixdown` → choose **WAV** for quality (or MP3 for quick review).  
- **Stems:** `Download ➜ Stems` (if available), or solo & export each group/track.  
- **Naming:** `Last_First_Project_V##` (e.g., `Lee_Ari_Foley_V04`).  
- **Delivery:** Upload mix + stems to the class Drive folder.

**Headroom & Loudness**
- Leave a little headroom on the master (avoid hard limiting during drafts).  
- For the final: use a **gentle limiter** to control peaks; compare against a reference at **matched volume**.

---

## 7) Collaboration & Feedback
- Students **fork** a template or each other’s projects for remix exercises.  
- Use **Comments** on the timeline for time‑stamped notes.  
- Use the **Chat** in the Group for resource links.  
- Encourage “**2+2**” feedback (two strengths, two next steps).  
- BandLab keeps **revision history**—students can A/B older versions.

---

## 8) Chromebook Tips & Gotchas
- If input won’t arm: **Site Settings ➜ Microphone ➜ Allow** for BandLab.  
- Close video calls/streams and heavy tabs; chrome://flags not required.  
- **Latency:** turn **input monitoring OFF**; record to the click with **count‑in**.  
- **No file picker?** Save recordings to **Downloads**, then **Drag & Drop** into BandLab.  
- If audio stutters: freeze/commit effects (render a track), or bounce a submix.

---

## 9) Phone Recording Best Practices
- Hold mic **just off‑axis** from the mouth to avoid plosives.  
- **Windscreen** outside; turn back to wind.  
- Stable mount = cleaner takes (use binder clip + rubber band hack).  
- Capture **5–10 sec room tone** each location.  
- Record **three takes** with level checks between.

---

## 10) Troubleshooting
- **No sound on playback:** Check device output; verify track is not soloed/muted; ensure FX chain isn’t maxing CPU.  
- **Distortion:** Lower input gain; back away; reduce clip gain pre‑compressor.  
- **Weird tempo/stretching:** Disable auto‑stretch for non‑loop samples; re‑align on the grid.  
- **Echo/feedback:** Turn off monitoring; use headphones; lower master level.  
- **Missing files:** Re‑import from Drive; keep a local copy in case of bandwidth issues.

## Day‑1 Student Handout (Copy/Paste)
1. Join the BandLab **Group** with the code from the board.  
2. Name your project using `Last_First_Project_V01`.  
3. Record a **20‑second “sonic ID”** (voice + one object).  
4. Trim, fade, and export an MP3 for the check‑in.  
5. Upload to the Drive “Week 1” folder and write one sentence about what you’d change next time.
