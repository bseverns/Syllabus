# Syllabus Archive

Welcome to the stash. This repo is my messy crate of syllabi and teaching experiments from years of hustling in classrooms.

## What's here?

Right now it's bare bones. The plan: each course gets its own folder with the stuff—syllabi, handouts, oddball assignments. Think of it as a living workbook.

### Courses

- **Arduino Sculpture (MCAD)** — microcontrollers meet molten glue guns. Source lives in its own repo: [ArduinoSculpture_MCAD](https://github.com/bseverns/ArduinoSculpture_MCAD).

More courses will roll in as I rummage through old drives.

## How to Navigate

When a course folder appears, open its README. It'll explain the vibe, outcomes, and how to remix it for your own class.

## Contributing

Snag ideas, fork things, and credit the source. Teaching is better when we share the weird stuff.
