### How to Use
1. **Number cues sequentially** even if you plan to skip them later; crossed-out cues tell the story of revisions.
2. **Log triggers in stage manager language** (Standby/Go) so anyone can step in and run the stack.
3. **Track operators**; rotate roles during Sessions 6–8 for redundancy.
4. **Note mix moves** (levels, fades, loops). Future you will thank present you.
5. **Cross-link** to assets: drop Drive/QLab links in the Notes column if you’re running hybrid.
