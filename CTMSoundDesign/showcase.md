# Showcase Checklist — Sound Design for Theater

This is the run-of-show blueprint for Session 8. Share with the stagecraft team so everyone knows when to breathe.

## Timeline
1. **T-48 hours:** Freeze cue edits. Export WAV + MP3 backups, update [Cue Sheet Template](./cue_sheet_template.md).
2. **T-24 hours:** Full cue-to-cue rehearsal with stagecraft + drama teams. Capture notes in a shared doc.
3. **Day-of (Call time = 60 minutes before audience):**
   - Power on playback rig, speakers, comms.
   - Run a level check for every cue (no audience surprises).
   - Set up a "quiet hold" zone backstage for last-minute editing if disaster strikes.
4. **House open:** loop a curated pre-show playlist at -20 dB. Student FOH greeter welcomes guests.
5. **Performance:** each pod delivers a 2–3 minute scene that includes at least one recorded sound, one edited loop, and one live cue.
6. **Strike:** archive cues + cue sheets to the class drive, label physical media, reset room.

## Required Elements
- **Original recordings** captured during the course.
- **Edited atmospheres/loops** showing layering skills.
- **Live cue execution** by student operators (no teacher at the board).
- **Stagecraft integration:** cues align with set pieces, lighting shifts, or prop action.

## Crew Roles
- **Student Stage Manager:** calls all cues using standby/go language.
- **Cue Operator(s):** run QLab/Go Button/BandLab session.
- **Spotter:** watches actors for physical triggers; communicates silently with SM.
- **Documentarian:** records audio/video snippets for post-show reflection.

## Assessment Touchpoints
Use this night to gather evidence for the [Assessment & Feedback](./syllabus.md#assessment--feedback) criteria.
- Capture SM call scripts with annotations.
- Note any tech hiccups for the reflection debrief.
- Collect quick audience feedback (two-question exit poll) for student portfolios.

## After the Applause
- Run the [Reflection Prompts](./reflection.md) within 24 hours while details are fresh.
- Encourage students to draft a short write-up or audio recap to share with families or on the school site.
- Archive everything so next year’s crew inherits your momentum.

This showcase is part concert, part lab report. Own the booth, keep it weird, and give the audience a reason to cheer for the techies.
