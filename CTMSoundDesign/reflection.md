# Reflection Prompts — Sound Design for Theater

Use these after Session 8 (or any major rehearsal) to capture honest insights before the adrenaline fades. Pair them with audio snippets or photos when possible.

## Individual Reflection
1. **Cue Confidence:** Which cue made you sweat the most, and how did you prep for it? Include timestamps or cue numbers.
2. **Collaboration Check:** How did communication with the stage manager or stagecraft team change over the project?
3. **Design Impact:** Describe a moment when the sound changed the audience’s reaction. Would you tweak levels, timing, or texture next time?
4. **Growth Edge:** What skill do you want to steal from the [Exploration Sound Design](../ExplorationSoundDesign/syllabus.md) playbook to level up?

## Team Retro
1. **Workflow Wins:** What kept your cue sheets, file naming, and backups under control?
2. **Chaos Moments:** Document any misfires (late cue, wrong level, file missing). How will you prevent the same mess next time?
3. **Interdisciplinary Moves:** Where did stagecraft or actors influence the sonic choices? Name the collaborators.
4. **Audience Pulse:** What feedback did you get from peers or the crowd? How does it align with your own assessment from the [Showcase Checklist](./showcase.md)?

## Next Iteration
- Draft a short action plan (3 bullets) for the next show: new gear to try, cues to redesign, communication habits to keep.
- Archive reflections alongside cue sheets so future crews inherit your lessons learned.

Reflection isn’t homework fluff—it’s your time to debrief like a pro team. Go deep, be honest, and leave notes your future self will high-five.
