# Teacher Quickstart Guide — Sound Design for Theater

Welcome to the booth crew. This quickstart is your checklist for keeping eight sessions tight, collaborative, and just the right amount of chaotic.

## Before Day 1
- **Survey the space:** map power, cable runs, safe mic zones, and a quiet corner for editing.
- **Sync with partners:** meet the stagecraft/drama teachers to align on narrative beats and the showcase format.
- **Gear prep:** charge recorders, label loaner headphones, print scripts, and drop the [Cue Sheet Template](./cue_sheet_template.md) into your shared drive.
- **Digital hub:** clone a class folder that includes this doc, the [Student Syllabus](./syllabus.md), [Showcase Checklist](./showcase.md), and [Reflection Prompts](./reflection.md).
- **Guest hype:** invite a local sound designer or the school’s audio tech to speak during Session 3 or 6.

## Weekly Rhythm
Each session runs on the pattern outlined in the [syllabus](./syllabus.md#session-roadmap-8x90). Keep these anchor moves handy:
- **Hook:** start with a cinematic moment—muted clip vs. scored clip, or a live cue misfire story.
- **Mini-lesson:** limit slides to 5–7 minutes; then demo live in the DAW. Reference the [Exploration Sound Design](../ExplorationSoundDesign/syllabus.md) materials when you need deeper dives on EQ/effects.
- **Lab:** circulate with a stage manager lens—ask "What is this cue serving?" not "Is this a cool sound?"
- **Collab rehearsal:** tag in the stagecraft instructor. Standby/go language every time.
- **Debrief:** rapid-fire “Keep / Tweak / Kill” or shout-outs from the booth.

## Spotlight Sessions
- **Session 2 (Editing):** preload an example project. Have students rebuild the cue after you mute key regions.
- **Session 3 (Playback):** run a mini mock tech with one group while others observe. Use actual comm headsets if possible.
- **Session 6 (Tech Prep):** require duplicate exports (WAV + MP3) and a labeled USB or Drive folder before they leave.
- **Session 8 (Showcase):** assign a student FOH greeter and a student backstage runner so you can stay at the console.

## Troubleshooting
- **Noise everywhere?** Move the foley pit to the hallway during recording blocks.
- **Cue sheet chaos?** Midweek, spot-check naming (`Show_Scene#_Cue#.wav`) and color-code critical cues.
- **Missed cues in rehearsal?** Swap operators mid-run; have the stage manager call cues louder/clearer.
- **Gear anxiety?** Run Session 0 for volunteers to learn QLab/Go Button basics.

## Resources to Have on Tap
- [Cue Sheet Template](./cue_sheet_template.md) — duplicate per pod; encourage students to add operator columns.
- [Showcase Checklist](./showcase.md) — hand this to stagecraft partners so timelines stay synced.
- [Reflection Prompts](./reflection.md) — build into Session 8 homework.

Stick with the plan but don’t fear the punk detour. If a hallway echo inspires a new cue, run with it—just log it in the sheet and keep the crew looped.
