# Teacher Quickstart Guide — Sound Design for Theater

## Preparation
- Arrange backstage access and invite sound designer guest if possible.
- Confirm available tech: recording devices, editing stations, playback software.
- Prepare cue sheet template for students.

## Session Highlights
- Session 1: Use a sound-on/sound-off video clip to spark discussion.
- Session 3: Send students in pairs to capture Foley sounds (doors, props, footsteps).
- Session 4: Keep editing goals simple (cut, fade, loop, normalize).
- Session 5: Practice calling cues with “standby/go” language.
- Session 7: Coach group roles (recordist, editor, cue operator).
- Session 8: Treat showcase like a real tech rehearsal — empower students to run their own show.
