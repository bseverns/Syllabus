# Sound Design for Theater — Student Syllabus

**Format:** 8 sessions · 90 minutes · integrated with Stagecraft build days  
**Audience:** Theater tech students who love tinkering with sound, props, and story  
**Primary tools:** Phones or handheld recorders, laptops with **Audacity** or **BandLab**, PA or powered speakers  
**Key docs:** [Teacher Quickstart](./teacher_quickstart.md), [Cue Sheet Template](./cue_sheet_template.md), [Showcase Checklist](./showcase.md), [Reflection Prompts](./reflection.md)

## Course Promise
We’re the sonic conspirators behind the show. Across eight scrappy sessions you’ll capture raw textures, sculpt them into cues, and run the board like a pro. The stagecraft crew handles walls and lights; we weaponize silence, drones, and well-timed thunder. By showcase night, you’ll debut a short performance where every cue lands because you built it that way.

## Learning Outcomes
By the final blackout, students will be able to:
1. **Design intentional sound cues** that reinforce mood, pacing, and story beats for live performance.
2. **Capture and edit original assets** using field recorders/phones, cleaning noise and balancing levels.
3. **Coordinate cue playback** with a calling stage manager using standard "standby/go" language.
4. **Document workflows** with cue sheets, cue stacks, and annotated rehearsal notes.
5. **Reflect on collaboration** between sound, set, and performance teams, proposing next-iteration tweaks.

## Collaboration Map
- **Stagecraft build days:** swap assets—sound designers trade recordings for prop textures; stagecraft offers set sketches you can score.
- **Stage Manager buddy:** assign one student SM per pod to log cues using the [Cue Sheet Template](./cue_sheet_template.md).
- **Drama teacher:** offers blocking notes; we mirror them with cue timing annotations.
- **Media crew:** borrow gear tips from the [Exploration Sound Design course](../ExplorationSoundDesign/syllabus.md) if you want deeper synthesis labs.

## Tech & Space Setup
- **Capture rigs:** smartphones with foam windscreens, one Zoom H4n if available, plus gaffer tape + clips.
- **Editing stations:** Chromebooks with BandLab (web) or laptops with Audacity + headphones/splitters.
- **Playback:** QLab, Go Button, or even BandLab stems played via interface—whatever’s reliable. Test with your stage manager before each run.
- **Room:** carve zones—quiet edit pod, foley pit, cue rehearsal corner with powered speakers.

## Assessment & Feedback
- **Process journal (30%)** — weekly upload of recordings + screenshots of edits.
- **Cue readiness (30%)** — clarity of cue sheets, file naming, and rehearsal responsiveness.
- **Design impact (30%)** — how well sound supports the narrative and stage picture.
- **Reflection (10%)** — use the [Reflection Prompts](./reflection.md) after showcase night to document wins + fixes.

Feedback cycle: peer walk-throughs each session, SM notes logged directly in cue sheets, final hot wash with stagecraft crew.

## Session Roadmap (8×90)
Each meeting follows **Hook (10) → Mini-lesson (15) → Lab (40) → Collab Rehearsal (20) → Debrief (5)**.

### Session 1 — Sound as Story Spine
- Listening lab: compare silent vs scored scene clips.
- Scavenger hunt: record three textures from the theater (door slam, prop scrape, ambient hum).
- Exit ticket: upload files using `Show_Scene#_Descriptor.wav` naming.

### Session 2 — Editing & Sculpting
- Mini-lesson: fade, EQ, compression quick hits (borrow slides from [Exploration Sound Design](../ExplorationSoundDesign/syllabus.md#week-3--rhythm-space-and-effects)).
- Lab: build a 30-second atmosphere bed plus a hard effect.
- Collab: stagecraft shares set sketches; students pitch sonic motifs for each location.

### Session 3 — Cue Language & Playback
- Warm-up: call-and-response of standby/go phrasing.
- Tool focus: QLab or Go Button basics; build a starter cue stack.
- Pod challenge: align cues with a scripted page from stagecraft. Update [Cue Sheet Template](./cue_sheet_template.md).

### Session 4 — Foley + Live Elements
- Foley pit: create footsteps, cloth, and impact hits with available props.
- Capture overhead: mic placement for consistency, ambient capture for loops.
- Collab rehearsal: run cues while stagecraft tests set changes.

### Session 5 — Syncing with Movement
- Mini-lesson: tempo mapping, hit points, and tap tempo.
- Lab: mark cue timings directly on scripts; practice calling cues with a student SM.
- Debrief: share strategies for communicating during chaos.

### Session 6 — Tech Rehearsal Prep
- File hygiene: bounce finalized cues, export backup MP3 + WAV, label drives.
- Run-through: simulate a partial tech rehearsal with lighting cues.
- Peer critique: trade pods, offer notes using "Keep / Tweak / Kill" frames.

### Session 7 — Full Tech + Fixes
- Full run with stage manager calling; refine levels and transitions.
- Emergency drills: what happens when a cue misfires?
- Update cue sheets + backups; confirm playback rig checklists.

### Session 8 — Showcase & Reflection
- Performance: each pod presents 2–3 minute scene (see [Showcase Checklist](./showcase.md)).
- Live mix: rotate cue operators mid-scene to test redundancy.
- Post-show: journaling using [Reflection Prompts](./reflection.md) + quick share-out with stagecraft partners.

## Extensions & Next Steps
- Want more studio polish? Bridge into the **Intro to Sound Design & Engineering** curriculum for deeper mixing chops.
- Document the project as a mini case study in the school newsletter—students create a behind-the-scenes audio blog.
- Archive cues + cue sheets in a shared drive so next year’s crew starts ahead of the game.
