# Arduino Sculpture (MCAD)

This course mashes up Arduino microcontrollers with sculpture. Students hack together kinetic objects, glitchy artifacts, and interactive installations.

The full code and lesson plans live at [ArduinoSculpture_MCAD](https://github.com/bseverns/ArduinoSculpture_MCAD). Clone it, break it, rebuild it.

## Highlights

- Teaches basic electronics through art-school chaos
- Encourages rapid prototyping and playful risk-taking
- Culminates in a final sculpture driven by code

## How to Use

Grab the repo above, read the docs, and adapt it. Feel free to feed back any improvements.
