# MEDIA2 Code Explainers

Tiny p5.js sketches used to demo concepts in Media 2. These are bare-bones, meant for students to tear apart.

| Folder | What's the trick? |
| --- | --- |
| `animate2` | swap between two drawings using `frameCount` and custom functions. |
| `animation` | conditionals that change shapes based on mouse position. |
| `flexibleParents` | attaching a canvas to a specific DOM element. |
| `push1` | `push()`/`pop()` drawing states. |
| `skyler_animate` | student experiment with arrays and random colors. |
| `snake` | array-powered trailing snake following the mouse. |
| `video` | play/pause HTML5 video inside p5. |
| `walking1_2022_02_18_22_43_09` | image layering and DOM text. |
| `while` / `whileVar` | using `while` loops, with and without color variation. |
| `whileIRVar` | placeholder for an interactive `while` loop demo (missing sketch). |

Open `index.html` in a browser or run them via the p5 editor.
