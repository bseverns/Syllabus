# FPV Safety & Policy (Use as a Starting Point)

This document is a **teaching aid**, not legal advice. Align with current FAA rules, school/district policy, and site permissions **before** operating.

## Core Practices
- **TRUST**: Each recreational pilot completes the FAA TRUST test (free) and keeps proof on hand.
- **Spotter / VLOS**: FPV pilots fly with a **visual observer** maintaining line‑of‑sight and airspace awareness.
- **Sub‑250 g builds**: Keep classroom builds under 250 g all‑up to reduce registration burdens; still follow safety rules.
- **Remote ID**: Current U.S. rules tie RID to aircraft that must be registered. Verify latest requirements for your aircraft/class.
- **VTX power/channels**: Use a posted channel plan; **limit to 25 mW indoors**; avoid interference; obey local authorization needs.
- **LiPo handling**: Charge in supervised, fire‑resistant areas; use LiPo bags/boxes; check cell health; store at 3.8 V/cell; dispose properly.
- **Space management**: Gates/cage inside a gym; cones and observer zones; prop guards/ducts on all classroom craft.
- **Incident response**: Stop power, secure battery, inspect for damage, document in incident log.

## Checklists
- **Charging Station**: Placard posted; bags in use; checker available; no unattended charging; fire materials present.
- **Pre‑Flight**: Frame intact, props tight, RX link solid, failsafe tested, VTX channel set, OSD voltage visible.
- **Post‑Crash**: Disarm → remove battery → inspect props/motors/FC → continuity as needed → replace damaged parts.

## Privacy & Consent
- Avoid recording people without consent. If using onboard DVR, announce and manage footage respectfully.

## Licensing Note
5.8 GHz analog VTX units may require an amateur (ham) license unless operating on certified gear/channels. Verify for your area.
