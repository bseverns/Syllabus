# Bench‑Check Checklist (Build Weeks)

**Checklist A — Pre‑Power**
- Visual: correct component orientation, clean joints, no stray strands
- Continuity: power pads to ground (no short), motor pad isolation, camera leads
- Harness: strain relief, heat‑shrink, cable routing clear of props

**Checklist B — First Power (No Props)**
- Smoke‑stop inline, bench supply or battery with current limit
- FC boots; receiver detected; gyro responds
- VTX channel & power set (25 mW indoors); OSD visible in goggles/monitor
- Arming disabled until failsafe verified

**Checklist C — Arming & Failsafe**
- Props off: arm logic works; stick endpoints calibrated
- Failsafe: radio off → motors stop; set drop or level as appropriate
- Final: props on; short hover test in cage; logs saved
