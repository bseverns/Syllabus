# Week 03 — Closed‑loop motion + PID intuition

**Time:** 1.5 hours  
**Targets:** feedback control idea; encoder read; proportional control

## Agenda
- **00:00–00:10** — Standup & safety callouts
- **00:10–00:35** — Mini‑lesson/demo
- **00:35–01:15** — Guided lab / drills (coach walk‑throughs)
- **01:15–01:25** — Debrief + DVR/logbook entries
- **01:25–01:30** — Reset & pack‑down

## Materials
- Encoders (if available); plotting/serial tools

## Drills / Labs
- Hold speed despite load; tune P only; note oscillation

## Assessment
- Exit ticket: What changed when P increased?
- Add to **Pilot Logbook** and commit DVR filename(s)

## Instructor Prep
Review prior logs; print drill cards; lay out spares and safety gear.
