# Week 01 — Course frame + safety; Arduino PWM & sensors

**Time:** 1.5 hours  
**Targets:** establish norms; review I/O and PWM; safe tool usage

## Agenda
- **00:00–00:10** — Standup & safety callouts
- **00:10–00:35** — Mini‑lesson/demo
- **00:35–01:15** — Guided lab / drills (coach walk‑throughs)
- **01:15–01:25** — Debrief + DVR/logbook entries
- **01:25–01:30** — Reset & pack‑down

## Materials
- Arduino driving base, USB cables, sensors
- Safety placards, first‑aid, extinguisher

## Drills / Labs
- Read sensor → drive motor; add a stop when threshold met

## Assessment
- Exit ticket: Describe PWM duty cycle vs speed; show one code snippet
- Add to **Pilot Logbook** and commit DVR filename(s)

## Instructor Prep
Review prior logs; print drill cards; lay out spares and safety gear.
