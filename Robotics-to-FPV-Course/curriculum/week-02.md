# Week 02 — Voltage domains & protection

**Time:** 1.5 hours  
**Targets:** 3.3↔5 V; current limits; back‑EMF; basic protection patterns

## Agenda
- **00:00–00:10** — Standup & safety callouts
- **00:10–00:35** — Mini‑lesson/demo
- **00:35–01:15** — Guided lab / drills (coach walk‑throughs)
- **01:15–01:25** — Debrief + DVR/logbook entries
- **01:25–01:30** — Reset & pack‑down

## Materials
- Level‑shifters or resistor dividers; diodes; motor driver
- Scope or logic probe (optional)

## Drills / Labs
- Map sensor to motor speed; observe brown‑outs; add flyback diode discussion

## Assessment
- Exit ticket: Sketch power path; label protections
- Add to **Pilot Logbook** and commit DVR filename(s)

## Instructor Prep
Review prior logs; print drill cards; lay out spares and safety gear.
