# Simulator Setup

Pick one (or both):
- **VelociDrone** (PC/Mac): strong physics, classroom‑friendly tracks.
- **FPV Freerider** (PC/Mac/Android): lightweight and inexpensive.

## Radio → USB
1. Power radio, set USB/joystick mode (or use trainer cable).
2. Calibrate sticks inside the simulator.
3. Set **rates/expo** (start gentle); map **arm** to a safe switch.

## First Drills
- Throttle steps (keep altitude bands)
- Hover box (centered, no yaw)
- Slow figure‑8 (keep the horizon level)
- Gate line (smooth line, no sudden inputs)

Log sim minutes and drills in your **Pilot Logbook**.
