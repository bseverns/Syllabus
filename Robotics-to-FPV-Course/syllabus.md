# Syllabus — Robotics → FPV (15 Weeks × 1.5 h)

**Teams:** 10 (2–3 students each)  
**Format:** Lab + drills + demos; short talks embedded in hands‑on time  
**Deliverables:** Working whoop, pilot logbook, DVR clips, repair notes, team demo

## Week‑by‑Week
**W1 — Course frame + safety culture.** Arduino base: PWM motors, sensor read.  
**W2 — Voltage control.** 3.3↔5 V, level shifting, back‑EMF; add a line‑follow/ultrasonic stop.  
**W3 — Motion character.** Encoders; simple closed‑loop speed; intro to PID.  
**W4 — From wheels to rotors.** BLDC/ESC demo; IMU axes; PID intuition with a tabletop rig.  
**W5 — Simulators + radios.** Install, bind USB, rates/expo, stick discipline drills.  
**W6 — Solder lab.** Through‑hole → fine work; harness building; continuity; strain relief.  
**W7 — Build 1.** Frame + motors + AIO FC/VTX + camera; continuity; prop‑on last.  
**W8 — Build 2.** ELRS bind phrase; Betaflight basics; OSD; arming safety; failsafe.  
**W9 — Safety & regs clinic.** LiPo handling, TRUST, spotter/VLOS, channel plan, 25 mW indoor cap.  
**W10 — Indoor LOS.** Hover boxes; gentle turns; crash protocol; quick repairs.  
**W11 — FPV (stabilized).** Gate lines; spotter drills; DVR review for coaching.  
**W12 — FPV (acro intro).** Horizon→acro; turtle mode; inspection; props/motors swaps.  
**W13 — Mission day.** Timed laps + precision land; team tuning sprints.  
**W14 — Field ops.** Outdoor session (weather/wind permitting); range/RSSI literacy.  
**W15 — Showcase + pack‑out.** Check‑rides, demos, maintenance, reflections.

## Assessment
- **Bench checks** (W7–W8): clean build, continuity, correct receiver/VTX setup, safe arming/failsafe.
- **Pilot check‑rides** (W10–W15): LOS hover → figure‑8 → gates; acro intro. DVR clip + reflection.
- **Artifacts:** Pilot logbook, repair sheets, short team talk on tuning + failure recovery.

## Materials
See `/build/FPV-whoop-BOM.csv` and `/build/Classroom-kit-BOM.csv`.

## Policies
- TRUST, spotter/VLOS, school/district rules, LiPo charging safety; defer to current local regulations.
