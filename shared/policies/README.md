# Policies with a Corita spin

Our classes run on Corita Kent's "Rules for Students and Teachers." Here's the whole score—tuck it somewhere you won't lose it:

1. RULE ONE: Find a place you trust, and then try trusting it for awhile.
2. RULE TWO: General duties of a student — pull everything out of your teacher; pull everything out of your fellow students.
3. RULE THREE: General duties of a teacher — pull everything out of your students.
4. RULE FOUR: Consider everything an experiment.
5. RULE FIVE: Be self-disciplined — this means finding someone wise or smart and choosing to follow them. To be disciplined is to follow in a good way. To be self-disciplined is to follow in a better way.
6. RULE SIX: Nothing is a mistake. There’s no win and no fail, there’s only make.
7. RULE SEVEN: The only rule is work. If you work it will lead to something. It’s the people who do all of the work all of the time who eventually catch on to things.
8. RULE EIGHT: Don’t try to create and analyze at the same time. They’re different processes.
9. RULE NINE: Be happy whenever you can manage it. Enjoy yourself. It’s lighter than you think.
10. RULE TEN: “We’re breaking all the rules. Even our own rules. And how do we do that? By leaving plenty of room for X quantities.” (John Cage)

Hints: Always be around. Come or go to everything. Always go to classes. Read anything you can get your hands on. Look at movies carefully, often. Save everything — it might come in handy later.

## How it plays out here

- 1 is our like trust fall: this classroom is the place, keep leaning in and we'll maybe end up somewhere unexpected, but definitely safe.
- 2 and 3 are the state of things. Our mutual scavenger hunt—grab knowledge from everyone and let them grab from you.
- 4 lets us use every assignment be a lab experiment; the mess is part of the lesson.
- 5 is asking you, dear reader, to turn discipline into a choice: pick mentors, chase better habits.
- 6 means flops are just drafts. There is still more time on the clock than you know.
- 7 grind beats luck, so show up and do the work.
- 8 is a reminder for us to separate jamming from judging and to honor the task at hand. Nearly a papradox anymore, but it pays dividends.
- 9 joy as a tool and method for living is a valid response to the world; use it whenever it shows up.
- 10  always leave wiggle room for the unexpected. Prepare to improvise as habit and still give it your everything.

The hints are our survival kit: keep showing up, devour media, and hoard scraps. Those connections will bail you out more than caffeine ever could.
